# elad-network

## Getting started

### On a bash terminal window, run the following commands:

 ```git clone https://github.com/yakkomajuri/elad-network/```
 
 ```cd website```
 
 ```npm install```
 
### Making sure you have a Mongo instance running on the background and a database named "elad" stored locally, you can then run: 

```npm start```

This will launch a server listening on port 3000. The script will run nodemon, which keeps track of server-side modifications so you do not have to restart the server each time. Happy coding!
